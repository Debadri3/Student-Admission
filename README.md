# Predicting the Age of cricketers from their stats
In this entirely self-made project, I try to predict the age of cricketers using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (Deep Neural Networks) from their statistics. I achieved an MAE of nearly 10 which implies that the generation of the cricketer can be predicted with certainty. Presence of ridiculous outliers might have affected the results.
